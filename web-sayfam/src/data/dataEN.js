React Router empowers me to seamlessly navigate between pages, while Axios ensures efficient handling of all API requests. React Redux serves as the backbone for managing global state effectively. For a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, I've incorporated Tailwind CSS and a selection of UI libraries. Additionally, React Hook Form streamlines form management and validation.
