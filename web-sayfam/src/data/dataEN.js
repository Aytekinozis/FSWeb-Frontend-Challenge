React Router empowers me to seamlessly navigate between pages, while Axios ensures efficient handling of all API requests. React Redux serves as the backbone for managing global state effectively. For a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, I've incorporated Tailwind CSS and a selection of UI libraries. Additionally, React Hook Form streamlines form management and validation. The website empowers users to sign up, sign in, browse products, and make purchases with ease.",
